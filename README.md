# Multi Crypto Exchange Arbitrage Trading

This project is a Python bot that automatically identifies and exploits price discrepancies between cryptocurrencies on different exchanges.

## Description

The bot uses a variety of techniques to find arbitrage opportunities, including:

* Spatial arbitrage: This involves buying an asset on one exchange and selling it on another exchange at a higher price.
* Triangular arbitrage: This involves buying three assets in a specific order, then selling them back in the reverse order to profit from the price differences.
* Riskless arbitrage: This involves buying and selling the same asset on different exchanges at the same time.

The bot is constantly monitoring the prices of cryptocurrencies on a variety of exchanges and executing trades as soon as an arbitrage opportunity is identified. It is designed to be highly efficient and profitable, and it can be used to trade a wide variety of cryptocurrencies.
